# SPLEE / Panopticum News

**Panopticum News** is an experimental project that explores new forms of engagement with news media through data-driven visualizations. The goal is to challenge traditional ways of consuming online news by highlighting patterns, biases, and structures in large-scale news datasets.

This work is part of the broader research project **SPLEE** â€“ _Scalable Practices for a Living, Experimental Europe_, which investigates alternative modes of digital public discourse.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains JavaScript scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for:

- Downloading and processing news data from **The New York Times** and **Zeit Online**
- Analyzing and extracting relevant features from the collected articles

The dataset spans a period of **18 months**, from **January 2024 to April 2025**:
