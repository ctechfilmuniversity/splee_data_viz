# Face recognition and analysis on images from online newspapers

The folder contains two scripts:

## 01.extract_facial_features.ipynb

This script takes a folder of images located in the `data` folder and processes them to extract facial features. The script partially relies on pre-trained face recognition algorithms, the result is manually refined to improve quality and accuracy.

## 02.create-cutouts.ipynb

The script processes the results of `01.extract_facial_features.ipynb` and produces a 1:1 cut out of the face included in the picture.
